# Happy hacking ;)
```

### Tasks

The title is not the right one, it is written title where it should be written the title variable from the data
Interpolate the title to have it working properly

-> Check the todo 1 in the code

#### 2.

Create your own Vue component,
Pass it some props to make it dynamic
